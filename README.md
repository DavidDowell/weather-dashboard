# weather-dashboard

This dashboard was created to keep track of the weather for people visiting a variety of cities.
In the search bar, the user can input a city they want to know current and future weather for and dynamic images will appear for a 5-day forecast.
This dashboard saves the user input in local storage and appends previous searches under the user input box.
